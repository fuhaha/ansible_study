# Commands used in Ian's 2016-09-06 demo
ansible all -m ping
ansible-playbook -s codes/async.yml

# Commands to run from within the VM to verify that pkg's were
# installed
dpkg -l {git,nginx} # Ubuntu
rpm -q {git,nginx}  # RHEL

# Run the same commands using Ansible's 'command' module
# -a --args (arguments to pass to the module)
ansible ubuntu_vm -m command -a 'dpkg -l git nginx'
ansible rhel_vm -m command -a 'rpm -q git nginx'

# Since 'command' is the default module, you don't need to specify it
ansible ubuntu_vm -a 'dpkg -l git nginx'
ansible rhel_vm -a 'rpm -q git nginx'

# NOTE2: In my ansible 'hosts' file I explicity specify the path to the
# python 2 binary because in some linux distros like Archlinux 'python'
# points to Python 3 instead of Python 2

# NOTE3: In 'Ansible Configuration Management' 1st ed the sample
# playbook for conditional execution in Ch3 has some syntax that
# doesn't work in Ansible 2.0+, namely:
#
# debug: msg=... fail=yes
#
# If you remove 'fail=yes' the task works fine, however

# NOTE4: Don't forget to customize the 'ansible.cfg' file from
# 'ansible_study.git'. Under [defaults] the first setting is
# 'inventory = ' which specifies the location of your ansible
# 'hosts' file. The default is '/etc/ansible/hosts'; change
# it to the sub-directory into which you ran 'git clone'
